1. Using venv (Built-in Python Module): The venv module comes with Python and allows you to create virtual environments. Hereâ€™s how to use it:
* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to your project directory (where you want to create the virtual environment).
* Run the following command to create a virtual environment (replace myenv with your desired environment name):
```
python -m venv myenv
```
*Activate the virtual environment:
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
